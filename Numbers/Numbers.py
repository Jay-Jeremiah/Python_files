# There are three types of numerical data types in python and these include:
# int
# float
# complex

x = 30       # x is an integer
pi = 3.14    # pi is a float number
z = 5j       # z is a complex number


# int is a whole number positive or negative without decimals

p = 30
q =-20
r = 4000

print(type(p))
print(type(q))
print(type(r))

# float are  numbers with decimals positive or negative 

s = 45.01
t = -21.999
u = 0.001

print(type(r))
print(type(t))
print(type(u))

# complex numbers are numbers written with an imaginary part

v = 3 + 5j
w = 6 - 4j
o = -7j

print(type(v))
print(type(w))
print(type(o))
